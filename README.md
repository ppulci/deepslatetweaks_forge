# Deepslate Tweaks *(forge repo)*

This mod lowers the strength value of Deepslate and Cobbled Deepslate to that of Stone. This change makes the time it takes to mine Deepslate and Stone equivalent, speeding up the players exploration. It encourages players to venture deeper into the world and removes the punishing feeling of doing so.

# Deepslate Tweaks *(Forge repo)*

Deepslate Tweaks lowers the strength of Deepslate to match Stone, restoring the classic mining pace deep underground. Since its introduction, Deepslate has been noticeably slower to mine than Stone — not enough to be interesting, just enough to be a time sink. Multiplied across the thousands of blocks a player mines below Y=0, that lost time adds up and gets in the way of the gameplay that's actually fun. This mod gives players that time back.

## What it changes

| Block | Vanilla hardness | New hardness | Matches |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deepslate | 3.0 | 1.5 | Stone |
| Cobbled Deepslate | 3.5 | 2.0 | Cobblestone |
| Deepslate Coal Ore | 4.5 | 3.0 | Coal Ore |
| Deepslate Iron Ore | 4.5 | 3.0 | Iron Ore |
| Deepslate Copper Ore | 4.5 | 3.0 | Copper Ore |
| Deepslate Gold Ore | 4.5 | 3.0 | Gold Ore |
| Deepslate Lapis Ore | 4.5 | 3.0 | Lapis Ore |
| Deepslate Redstone Ore | 4.5 | 3.0 | Redstone Ore |
| Deepslate Diamond Ore | 4.5 | 3.0 | Diamond Ore |
| Deepslate Emerald Ore | 4.5 | 3.0 | Emerald Ore |

Blast resistance is unchanged for Deepslate and Cobbled Deepslate; ore variants use the same 3.0/3.0 strength as their surface counterparts.

## How it works

The mod applies a single [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) to `net.minecraft.world.level.block.Blocks` that intercepts each block's `strength(...)` builder call during class initialization and swaps in the new values. No blocks are replaced or re-registered, so the change is invisible to other mods and datapacks — Deepslate is still Deepslate, it just breaks faster.

Because only block properties are modified, the mod is:

- **Server-side friendly** — install it on a server and vanilla-adjacent clients will still see correct break speeds (block breaking is server-authoritative).
- **Safe to add or remove** at any time; it stores nothing in the world.

## Compatibility

- **Minecraft:** 26.2 (on Forge 65.0.4; see earlier releases for 1.21.1, 1.21.5, 1.21.8, 1.21.10, 1.21.11, 26.1.2)
- **Mod loader:** Forge (this repo is Forge-only; NeoForge and other loaders live in separate repos)
